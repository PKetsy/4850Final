                These Royal Red Shrimp are one of our most popular items! Royal
                Red Shrimp have a delicate and sweet flavor, often described as
                similar to lobster. These shrimps are known for their vibrant
                red colors, which intensify when cooked. These shrimp are
                generally larger than most shrimp species, and inhabit waters
                from 200-2000ft deep. Due to these depths, they are bit more
                challenging to catch compared to other shallow-water shrimps.
                These shrimp can be boiled, grilled, or saut√©ed to perfection,
                and are fantasitc in numerous recipes.
